For this assignment, we had to write a program that would print out a color every 10th time through a loop. The colors printed had to be printed 3 times, then move on to the next color to be printed 3 times.
The colors were red, green, and blue - thus the output for 70 loops would be: RED, RED, RED, GREEN, GREEN, GREEN, BLUE.

This assignment was very difficult for me to understand how to approach and work through!
Because we had just learned while loops, I began by creating a while loop to print "RED" every 10th time. My code for that worked, but then I had to figure out how to make it change colors.


A tip for this project is to **utilize checks within the code more often!!!**
I didn't utilize checks for my outputs, in the beginning of me working through the project, and was in turn only guessing at where the issue was. I thought that the issue was specifically at 120 runTimes, and continued to try to figure out why it was happening there.
I ended up changing a lot of conditions that weren't the issue until I thought to utilize a check for what number loop we were on.
I did this by printing out the integar with when the color RED was printed and found out that the issue was actually at 100 instead of 120.
