For this assignment, my buzzer needed to emit either SOS or MELI in morse code when a circuit was open or closed! To do this, similarly to the jammin' assignment, I used an if-else statement to check if the circuit was closed or opened, and then made new functions for MELI and SOS. I started off by simply making the functions the morse code for the full word, but realized that it was confusing to see where each letter began or ended. I ended up created functions for each of the letters, and then functions for each of the words using the letter functions.

Here is a picture of my set up!

A tip for this assignment would be to start with each letter individually before you try to combine them! I confused myself trying to figure out how long each pause should be between each letter but also within the letters, and had to go back and break it up into further chunks since I tried to do them all at the same time.
