#### Mr. Mothie has been born!!

My plushy was created during an assignment where I had to build a circuit with 3 LEDs, a button and a switch.
I wasn't sure what I wanted to create but Alex Marshall helped inspire me
by showing me luna moths! Athough the shape isn't exactly like a luna moth, and the fake eyes aren't exactly like the ones on their wings,
I hope that the antennea give the vibe of a luna moth!

Once I decided where the LEDs were going to go, I created a paper prototype which I then tested with alligator clips! I then embroidered the
luna moth design onto my felt, and used stainless steel thread to sew the circuit onto my plushy. Mr. Mothie was stuffed with some fabric
scraps to help prevent the circuit from short-circuting, and then had his antannea sewn on before he was fully stitched closed.

Here is the:

Some things to keep in mind before starting this project (things I wish I knew):
- Careful with how you fold the fabric when sewing the circuit if the battery is connected! I don't know how I folded it, but it started to smell a little burnt and one LED turned on before I had fully closed the circuit.
- Maybe do not put the battery in until you are sure the stainless steel thread won't touch.
- If you are doing embroidery along the edges of the plushy, leave more space between the edge and where the embroidery is.
- Use heat activated pens to draw your design! I was unable to remove and accidental design draw, and then didn't draw my circuit on and forgot one LED.
