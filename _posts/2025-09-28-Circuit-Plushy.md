The creation of Mr. Mothie began with an assignment to sew a circuit with 3 LEDs, a switch and a button into a felt plushy. I began by designing the front of my plushy to determine where the LEDs were going to be placed, ending up with inspiration from luna moths at the suggestion of Alex Marshall!

Once I decided on the LEDs placement, I created a paper prototype of how the wires would lay on the plushy to create the circuit. I then tested the prototype with alligator clips to ensure my circuit worked.

Here are the prototypes made!

I then embroidered the luna moth design onto my felt, and used stainless steel thread to sew the circuit onto my plushy. Mr. Mothie was stuffed with some fabric scraps to help prevent the circuit from short-circuting, and then had his antannea sewn on before he was fully stitched closed.

Some things to keep in mind before starting this project (things I wish I knew):
- Careful with how you fold the fabric when sewing the circuit if the battery is connected! I don't know how I folded it, but it started to smell a little burnt and one LED turned on before I had fully closed the circuit.
- Maybe do not put the battery in until you are sure the stainless steel thread won't touch.
- If you are doing embroidery along the edges of the plushy, leave more space between the edge and where the embroidery is.
- Use heat activated pens to draw your design! I was unable to remove and accidental design draw, and then didn't draw my circuit on and forgot one LED.
