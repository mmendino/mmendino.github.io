The creation of Mr. Mothie began with an assignment to sew a circuit with 3 LEDs, a switch and a button into a felt plushy. I began by designing the front of my plushy to determine where the LEDs were going to be placed, ending up with inspiration from luna moths at the suggestion of Alex Marshall!

Once I decided on the LEDs placement, I created a paper prototype of how the wires would lay on the plushy to create the circuit. Then, I tested the prototype with alligator clips to ensure my circuit worked.

Here are the prototypes made!

After this, I used the tape to hold down my components in place on the felt and began sewing my circuit with stainless steel thread onto my plushy. I should have also drawn on my circuit in addition to taping down the components because I forgot to close the circuit on one of my LEDs, causing it to not turn on. It all worked out in the end though!
Here is the front and back of my circuit!

I cut the stainless steel thread where I messed up, and added more thread to resew the circuit including the negative side of the LED that was left out!

Once my circuit was working and completed, I embroidered the luna moth design onto my felt to create Mr. Mothie! He was then stuffed with some fabric scraps to help prevent the circuit from short-circuting, and had his antannea sewn on before he was fully stitched closed.

Some things to keep in mind before starting this project (things I wish I knew):
- Careful with how you fold the fabric when sewing the circuit if the battery is connected! I don't know how I folded it, but it started to smell a little burnt and one LED turned on before I had fully closed the circuit.
- Maybe do not put the battery in until you are sure the stainless steel thread won't touch.
- If you are doing embroidery along the edges of the plushy, leave more space between the edge and where the embroidery is.
- Use heat activated pens to draw your design! I was unable to remove and accidental design draw, and then didn't draw my circuit on and forgot one LED.
