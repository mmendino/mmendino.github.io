Assignment, screenshots, tips
Today I created a program to give a user meals from two different menus based on whether their chosen number is even or odd. An even number will allow the user to choose from 4 different meal options on a regular menu. An odd number will allow the user to choose from 3 meal options from a super secret menu.

To do this, the program uses **nested if blocks** to seperate the different menu options by whether or not it is even or odd, using modular arithmetic.

One tip I have for past me is to try your if statement for even or odd numbers before moving on and see if there is anyway to simplify it. I initially started with sorting out the odd numbers, but realized that sorting out the even numbers required simpler code.
