Today I created a program to give a user meals from two different menus based on whether their chosen number is even or odd.
To do this, the program uses **nested if blocks** to seperate the different menu options by whether or not the chosen number is even or odd, using modular arithmetic. Then, the user has to choose another number to get their meal option!

For EVEN chosen numbers, the user gets a basic dinner menu with 4 different options as seen below!


For ODD chosen numbers, the user gets to choose from a fun drink and dessert menu with 3 options as seen below!


One tip I have for past me is to try your if statement for even or odd numbers before moving on and see if there is anyway to simplify it. I initially started with sorting out the odd numbers, but realized that sorting out the even numbers required simpler code. Because I did this at the end, I had to make sure that my moving around of my code didn't mess anything up and that the brackets were in the appropriate places.
