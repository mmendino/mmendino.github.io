For the "Jammin'" assignment, we were to create a program where the buzzer on the Lilypad plays a song or tune whenever the switch turns on. I ended up looking for a song called "Burrito Sabanero" because it is a spanish christmas song but the code was very confusing. I tried another song, MAMII by Karol G and Becky G that I found on [Rocoblog](https://rocoblog.blogspot.com/2022/04/musica-con-arduino-uno-y-un-buzzer.html) by Francisco Roco. It ended up working! I wasn't able to make it stop before reaching the end of the loop, but when the switch is off, the music doesn't loop back again.

Here is a picture of the setup!

A tip is to go back to the slides to see what is needed for switch codes! I forgot to convert the output of the switch to a value and thus my if statement conditional wasn't working.
