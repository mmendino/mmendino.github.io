For the "Jammin'" assignment, we were to create a program where the buzzer on the Lilypad plays a song or tune whenever the switch turns on. I ended up looking for a song called "Burrito Sabanero" because it is a spanish christmas song but the code was very confusing. I tried another song, MAMII by Karol G and Becky G and idk yet if it works.
