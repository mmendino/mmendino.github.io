<center><b>All hail the mighty seam ripper!</b></center>

One of our assignments this week was to create a sample of different embroidery stitches on muslin fabric.
The sample consisted of:
+ running stitch
+ cross stitch
+ back stitch
+ satin stitch
+ stem stitch
+ blanket stitch
+ whip stitch

In addition to these stitches, we had the opportunity to choose two more stitches to learn and practice! I decided to do three stitches that I hadn't used before. These are:
+ feather stitch
+ chain stitch
+ woven rose stitch

One thing I wish I knew prior to this project is that seam rippers should never be forgotten!
I was trying to remove my stem stitches from next to my completed satin stitches on the W... and I cut off half of my satin stitches. I only had my scissors on hand, and wanted to finish the W on that sewing sesh, and tried to cut off the top part of the stem stitches. I succeeded in removing the stem stitches, but also cut off the edge of my satin stitches and had to remove those as well... Had I had a seam ripper, I could have made the cuts more precise and saved myself from redoing more work.
