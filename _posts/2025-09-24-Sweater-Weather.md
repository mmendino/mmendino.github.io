To learn about and practice using if / else if / else statements in coding, I created a program to tell the user what to wear
depending on the the temperature in Fahrenheit.
As part of the assignment, we had to create at least 5 different statements, and ensure that a wide range of temperatures would produce an appropriate output.

Here is the output if the temperature is 300째F:
![Output reads: Temp is 300 degrees, do not go outside. you do not have any clothing to be able to survive.](https://github.com/mmendino/mmendino.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/sweater300.jpg?raw=true)

Here is the output for 80째F:
![Output reads: Temp is 80 degrees, shorts or pants are okay, any tshirt is good.](https://github.com/mmendino/mmendino.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/sweater80.jpg?raw=true)

For 30째F:
![Output reads: Temp is 30 degrees. Winter jacket, sweater, pants, gloves. Maybe base layers. It's officially freezing.](https://github.com/mmendino/mmendino.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/sweater30.jpg?raw=true)

And for -40째F:
![Output reads: Temp is negative 40 degrees, do not go outside. you do not have any clothing to be able to survive.](https://github.com/mmendino/mmendino.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/sweater-40.jpg?raw=true)


Something that I wish my past self knew going into this project would be to create my ranges of temperatures with what I wanted
to be output before I started to code. I kept getting stuck on what ranges I had to do next, and what temperatures were missing.
Doing that before would have helped me be more organized and allowed me to check my code while I worked on the program.
I think I did a good job of checking my code at the beginning of the process, to understand what was going on in the code and if any errors popped up.
But I also think that I added too many statements and got caught up on figuring out what someone needed to wear at a certain temperature.
