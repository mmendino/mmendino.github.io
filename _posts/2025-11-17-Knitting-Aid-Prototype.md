the Knitting-Aid! a companion to all knitters

A tea cup shaped plushie that helps knitters keep track of their rows by pressing a teabag shaped button. the Knitting-Aid will play a short tune and turn on a RGB LED when you have completed 10 rows. If you want to know what row number you are on between the 10 rows, you will open a little flap to give light to the light sensor. A series of 4 pink LEDs will turn on to show the binary number of the row you are on!

For my paper prototype, I tried to make it as close as I could to the real size of what I will be making. I traced out the size of the components to make sure they were to size. I still need to figure out how to insulate the long traces for the button, maybe embroidering over it or simply adding fabric paint to the front and back of it.
For the light sensor, I will add a decorated flap that will be covering it to make sure that no light is detected until I need it. I will have a velcro strip keeping it closed.

Prototype for the front:

The back:

The back will have a velcro strip that the tea bag button can stick to. The buzzer will also be placed on the back to ensure the front is not too confusing.
