For this assignment, I had to write an Arduino program to turn on the onboard RGB light to a random color whenever the button was pressed. We learned how to include a button into our program, which was weird because LOW means it is pressed? And we learned how RGB lights make different colors and can be programmed to make whatever color you want!

One tip! My light would cycle through so many random numbers every time I pressed the button and I could not figure out how to catch the first random number. I realized I needed to make a state-based variable to help catch it and was able to figure it out from there.
