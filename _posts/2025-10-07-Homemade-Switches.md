For this assignment, I made two homemade switches to light up two LEDs on my sewing sampler from 22 September!
One of the switch uses a satin stitch with stainless steel thread on one side, and a paperclip on the other side - the circuit closes when the paperclip touches the satin stitch.
The other switch is a homemade button, I connected conductive thread to the fabric, and then sewed another piece of conductive thread on to a piece of felt. I added an extra piece of felt to go between the two conductive fabric pieces so that they are not contantly touching.
The felt piece between the conductive fabric is only in the outline of the heart shape, and the middle of the felt is open so that the circuit will close when I press on it.

Here is my paper prototype and the layout of the paper prototype!

Here is my prototype with alligator clips!

The back of the work:

One hint I would have is to ensure there is enough space between the conductive pieces for the homemade button - I initially made the hole in the felt too big and the pieces touched at all times. I had to add more felt to make the hole smaller and make sure that there isn't stray conductive material touching!
