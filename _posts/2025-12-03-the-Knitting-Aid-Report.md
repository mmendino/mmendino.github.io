the Knitting-Aid is every knitters companion! This adorable teacup-shaped product helps a knitter (or crocheter) keep track of their rows
and informs them when it is time to make a change! This specific model shows the knitter when they are on every 10th row to increase or decrease their stitches. You simply need to press the teabag shaped button after you have completed a row, and it will keep track of the total rows.
To see what row number you are on, you simply open a flap to allow the light sensor to recieve light, and the four pink LEDs on top of the teacup show the number in binary code. The RGB light on the lilypad tells you whether the number shown by the pink LEDs is in the ones, tens, or hundreds place! The red is the ones, green is the tens, and blue is the hundreds.
When you reach every 10th row by pressing your completed 9th row, the RGB light with turn cyan and the Tinkerbell DS Game's Intro music plays. The tune only plays once, but the cyan light will be on until you complete the 10th row.

The motivation for this product arose from my issue trying to keep track of my rows while knitting the Sophie Hood by PetiteKnit. I was knitting the large size where I had to increase every 10th row, but needed to keep a notebook and pen to count my rows.
This wasn't very comfortable and sometimes I would lose my writing instrument, which is why, with the Knitting-Aid, you simply have to push a button to count your rows and it will inform you when it is time to increase.

Tips to my past self!
- Do not forget to code your project in sections! I was overconfident and tried to code my actions all together, but realized that I couldn't test it unless it was in separate files.
