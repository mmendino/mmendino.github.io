Hello!

I am Melissa Mendino Solano and I am senior Psychology and Studio Art Major. I am interested in education and working with family history, specifically history from my small town in Mexico.

I primarily work with textiles in my art - hand-sewing and embroidering. I have hand-sewn a queen sized quilt, but also my senior seminar art piece. 

I do not have any programming experience, although I have always wished I was part of the *myspace* era.

By taking CSCI 103, I am hoping to learn new skills to make my art more interactive with the world around it. In high school, we briefly worked with circuits and it was so much fun, I also want to learn how to build and integrate circuits into my work. 

A boring fact about me...
My favorite color is pink.
