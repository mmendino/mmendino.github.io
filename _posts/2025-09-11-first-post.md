Hello!

I am Melissa Mendino Solano and I am senior Psychology and Studio Art Major. I am interested in the education system and love to work oral history in art.

My work primarily consists of textiles, and thus I would consider myself proficient in sewing. Although I know how to machine sew, I greatly prefer hand-sewing.

I do not have any programming experience, although I have always wished I was part of the *myspace* era.

By taking CSCI 103, I am hoping to learn new skills to make my art more interactive with the world around it. In high school, we briefly worked with circuits and it was so much fun, I also want to learn how to build and integrate circuits into my work. 

A boring fact about me...
My favorite color is pink.
