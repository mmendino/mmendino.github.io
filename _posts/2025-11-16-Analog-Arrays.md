For this assignment, we had to use the PWM (analog) pins on our Lilypad Arduinos! 

Here is a picture of when all of my PWM pins were randomly on, and one picture during a random segment of flashing.


Tip to myself: After the code works, go back to see what could be more efficient! I write out comments for what states I have to catch, and it helps me organize my code and write it out. But, I ended up using if, else if, instead of just if and else because I was writing what needed to happen. I simplified that, and then I realized that I had created an extra variable that I didn't need for the random pin choice, and was able edit my code further.
