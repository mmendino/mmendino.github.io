Mr. Mothie's circuit that included 3 LEDs, a button and a switch, would only turn on when the switch was on and the button was pressed.
The program created for this assignment prints whether each of the 3 LEDs are on or off, based on the values of the button and switch which determine the values of the LEDs.

When the button is on, and the switch is on, this is the output:


Whenever the button is off or the switch is off, or both are off, this is the output:


One tip I have for myself is that each of the LEDs have to be checked! I initally wrote a program that would do them all at the same time, but it didn't allow for any of the LEDs to have different values from each other.
