I am Melissa Mendino Solano, a senior at Williams College studying Studio Art and Psychology.

Some fun facts:

- I'm from Houston, TX
- My favorite color is pink
- I love my truck, she's a beaut

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
