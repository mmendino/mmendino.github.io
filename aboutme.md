subtitle: Why eTextiles?
---

Hi! I am Melissa Mendino Solano and I am a senior at Williams College majoring in psychology and studio art. My interests lie in the education field and family history. I am taking electronic textiles because I mostly work with fabric in my art and want to find new ways to work with textiles. Through using a medium that I am familiar with, I am also hoping that learning to code will be more approachable for me.


Some fun facts:
- I'm from Houston, TX
- My truck's nickname is trucky wucky because I love her and she's a beaut.
- I'm engaged! <3
